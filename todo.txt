1. Async-storage examples:
STORE
=====
let user = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30,
    email: 'john.doe@example.com'
};

// Stringify the user object
let stringifiedUser = JSON.stringify(user);

// Store the stringified user object
AsyncStorage.setItem('user', stringifiedUser);

RETRIEVE
========
// Retrieve the stringified user object
let stringifiedUser = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');

// Parse it back into an object
let user = JSON.parse(stringifiedUser);

// Now you can access the individual values
console.log(user.name);  // 'John Doe'
console.log(user.age);   // 30
console.log(user.email); // 'john.doe@example.com'

CHECK IF DATA EXISTS
====================
const checkData = async (key) => {
  const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
  if(value !== null) {
    console.log('Data exists');
  } else {
    console.log('No data with this key');
  }
}

checkData('user');

IMAGE PICKER
Yes, it could be a permissions issue. On Android, you need to request the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access the photo library, and on iOS, you need to add the NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key to your Info.plist file.

However, starting from version 3.0.0, react-native-image-picker should handle permissions automatically on Android. On iOS, you still need to add the usage description to your Info.plist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add multiple arrays to async item:
CREATE & STORE
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const storeData = async (value) => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(value)
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('@storage_Key', jsonValue)
  } catch (e) {
    // saving error
    console.log(e);
  }
}

// Call the function with your array
storeData(['item1', 'item2']);

ADD ANOTHER ARRAY
const addData = async (newArray) => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@storage_Key')
    let currentArray = jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : [];
    const updatedArray = [...currentArray, ...newArray];
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('@storage_Key', JSON.stringify(updatedArray));
  } catch(e) {
    // read error
    console.log(e);
  }
}

// Call the function with your new array
addData(['item3', 'item4']);

Review Changes 14-03-25

General app notes:
------------------
[√] Can we rearrange the home page icons to be in order : Shopping, Entertainment, Services, Health and Wellness, Travel, Porperty, Education and Employment, Community.
    [√] Browse
    [√] Shopper
[√] Under shopping can we add Agriculture to Hardware and electrical ie: Agriculture, Hardware and Electrical
    [√] Main array
    [√] Signup - shopper
    [√] Signup - business
    [√] Edit/manage shopper profile
    [√] Edit/manage business profile
    [-] Need new graphic for new button
[√] Under Property can we add a note under the icons to say “For building, search Services”

Browse businesses;
------------------
[√] Under “read more about the benefits of signin up’ the notifications section can just state’ “Notifications personally tailored to your interests” and add “Option for paid membership subscription with further discounts and benefits on offer”
[?] When you click the profile person, search function, review, support or notifications toggle, it should offer a sign up now to set up a profile link option?

Business Sign up:
-----------------
[√] The check box on business sign up should read “Are you a local business?”
[√] When I opened my Business page that I set up, the page is reading” 33 Bookings” when I have only just set it up, will this page also show other diagnostics and statistics such as how many views and links to web/social media/location the business has had over the app, so they can quantify the apps value to them, you said that all of these could be tracked except phone calls. It is showing 0 views, but I have viewed it from the user page I set up. They need to be able to see this in order to decide whether to stay on the app when it starts charging as discussed.
[√] I feel the business sign in should open onto its profile page, rather than a review page
[√] After signup goto profile page
[√] Everytime I close the app it logs me out, it should stay signed in for ease of use.
    [√] We need to still do a login, similar to the remember me.
[√] When I click on my Instagram or facebook links on my busness profile page, it just comes up with a pop up saying invalid url, should this not take me to the relevant page?
    [√] Show that e.g. https://www.facebook.com/ is pre-appended. Perhaps show the full url below and user just adds in handle. Warn if url is in twice
    [√] In the signup, pre-append the to the inputs
    [√] In bus profile setup add a test button/facility
[√] When you open the address of the business, it just opens maps, not the actual address in maps, not sure if this is because it’s a random address ive used for my business page or it will always do this. 
    [√] What id discussed with maps is that it should open to the businesses address, so users can seamlessly find directions without then having to manually enter the address again.  
    [√] Can we add a location pin for address or event set up? Or can we discuss how this is set up to work.
        - Add a View on map util
        [√] Add View map to event add
        [√] Add View map to event edit
        [√] Test on shopper > search
        [√] promotions
            [√] Add View on map to add and edit screens
    [√] Need to make a util to check and set the gps co-ords
[√] Add an option to goto login option screen
[√] Business > Profile > Event : Fix layout
[√] Business > Profile > Promo : Fix layout
[√] When you go to bookings calendar it must auto fetch bookings from the server.
    [√] Check booking menupage
    [√] dashboard page must fetch booking count every time user goes to it

[-] The logo and banner images are still glitching and swopped around, not a seamless experience for loading pictures in the right place. ie: The picture I load for Logo is coming up as the banner picture and vice versa and then not able to correct it.
    - Works fine for me!!!
    - Where do you see the display pic and where do you see the banner pic???
[!] When we work on the pricing plan, we will need to offer option for more than one branch and each separate branch should have its own page details, how is this possible?
[!] When I tried to open the calendar, the whole screen went blank, but seems to be coming up now: QQQ: I cant duplicate the error

User sign up:
-------------
[√] On the Home page can we have the Localeyez Logo and slogan at top, then “Hello, Name” and the notifications and profile picture (not person image) with notifications and profile written eg: see Facebook
    [√] Logo and slogan at the top
[-] add a toggle button at the bottom where they can easily change their area range. 
[√] I think the bottom toggle buttons should say what they are underneath ie: Home, Search, Diary, Reviews, Support eg: see facebook
[√] (Where are support admin contact emails sent?)
[√] Businesses actual address to open in maps as above.
[√] Remember me on sign in should keep the person logged in and open to their home page
[√] I tried to run a search on my user page for a business under the category that I set my business page up as and nothing came up , not sure if random address issue again?
    [√] ASK: Did she search fpr part of the name?
        - partial search works fine
        - no results caused by 10km radius thingy
[√] Search function, why two search/next pages for businesses to come up?
    [√] Remove hide search box




[-] Search :: Is getting old results !!!
[-] Instead of the “find what you’re looking for function on homepage
[-] Can the fake businesses be taken off before we start to launch the app and get business signed up?
[-] Share event seems to just open a blank web page on localeyez.net saying “check this event out:6” ?
[-] Can a user with a personal and business page with the same email address seamlessly swith between their profiles?
[-] When I search for shopping > clothes and I get a result there is no counter for number of promo or events
[√] Fix events listing
    [√] Maybe put Starts on 1 line and data on the next etc
    [√] Date and time use "at" between date and time and not a dash
    [√] Add a View om map link to space between SHARE button
[√] Serach > view event looks great, just add a View on map thingy below address
[√] Serach > view promotion looks great, just add a View on map thingy below address
[√] Search > Fix promo layout
[√] Search > Fix event layout
[√] Add view on map to Search > Bus > Event ::: Events (is it the same screen)
[√] Add an option to goto login option screen

[-] Confirm the app picks up when the user is in a new location?

[-] With maputil on businesses, we might need to ensure that we have gps coords in order for geo-location shit to work


To Add an item to the shopping Sectors
======================================
 - worked on these files
   - FIRST StEP: Add to sector.data.js
   - shopper > StepOne: Add the new item to the blank shoppingSecotrs array
   - shopper > SetupTwo: Add into the list -> Checkbox or list -> ADD to save record object
   - shopper > account > interests > home.jsx: Update const fullDesc
   - shopper > account > interests > add.jsx: Do the same changes as StepTwo
- At this point the default/blank sectors array has been created in StepOne
- Using sectors.data.json (new item was aded here as well) is displayed in sStepTwo
- If user finished registration the new shopping sectors with the new item is saved to the users profile
- If the user view sector array displays right, if they add or edit the local sectors array is updated and the server

SERVER
- search_controller > search_category
  - api_search_model => getBusinessesByCategory
    - add item to arrays at the top



Next steps:
18-03-2025
√ BUSINESS: Do the same to business sectors
√ SEARCH: Will need coding in the items category >>> BROWSE and SHOPPER
√ SEARCH: Will need to update the Api
√ API : Also check full in and out

To Check: If an old user (before new item) logs in and then go to edit interest is the new item there, can the select it and all saves ok?

19-03-2025
√ Do autologin for businesses
√ Social media kakkas - bus only


NEXT STEP 21-03-2025
1. When a business is setup we need a way to get guranteed gps co-ords
2. These co-ordinates must be saved to the server
   - Will need to remove the function in the api to get the coords
3. In bus setup signup2.jsx
   - Under location add a choice switch: Enable geo-location search ?
   - If you enable geo-location search the app will get the gps co-ordinates of the address you supplied above.
   - If disable geo-location your business will not be displayed in the results if a user has selected a search radius.
4. If user enables then display a hidden facility with:
   - a button GET GPS Co-ords
   - map is then shown with a marker
   - buttons underneath: Accept | Retry (Here the user can review his address details (Maybe show a message below saying that if the co-ords dont look right then please double check the address they type in))
5. If user taps RETRY then a popup saying "Please check that the address you entered is correct and then tap on GET GPS again. If you would like to set this up later disable the GPS lookup facility switch
  - gps lat/lng = 0.0
6. If user taps ACCEPT then save co-ord to state and continue

BACKEND: Disable the code that gets the co-ords and save the passed in co-ords
